	<h2> CESSDA Training Activities 2020 </h2>	
	<p> The CESSDA Training Group and GESIS will collaborate to ensure that the proposed activities for 2020 meet the priority needs of CESSDA, the Training Group and enable GESIS to develop its training capacities as well.</p>
	<p> The work falls into three categories:</p>
	<p> <ol>
		<li> regular maintenance, including event support, promotion, maintenance and supplying content for websites (CESSDA Data Management Expert Guide, CESSDA Events, etc.). </li>
		<li> design, development, and some content (detailed below) of an online Data Archiving Guide (DAG), a resource for repository staff modelled on the much-used Data Management Expert Guide. </li>
		<li> organise and run an event, CESSDA Training Days, building on the model used in 2019. </li>
	</ol></p>
	<p>Duration</p>
	<p>January - December 2020</p>
